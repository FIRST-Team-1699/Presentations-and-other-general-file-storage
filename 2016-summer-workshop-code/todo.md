# 2016-code-workshop

Teaching Java and WPILib for FRC robot programming.

# Basics

What programming experience do people already have?

Might have to start with variables.

Then, **need** to start on classes and objects. The class is the blueprint for the object. Use Pizza.java and Slice.java. Give Pizza toppings, methods, then give Slice similar settings, make Pizza generate slice with same toppings, size, etc.

# Starting WPILib

## Eclipse

Most of the team PCs should have Eclipse installed with WPILib. If not, then install quickly and move on.

Show some basics of Eclipse, maybe Jakob should do this.

## Basic IterativeRobot

Show the Basic IterativeRobot, which is only a robot that will drive. Show how joysticks are made and used, and how they pull the project together.

Add fuctionality to Basic IterativeRobot. Game piece shooters are easy, frisbee or dodgeball. Maybe look at using the lifter from last year.

Maybe look at sensors and how they work.

Maybe *maybe* look at PID and how to solve the slipping problem from last year. Depends on group.

Maybe start to look at how to wire robots, what to do and what not to do.

Maybe also look at vision for robots.

Maybe show ini reader usage and how it is useful.

Maybe *maybe* *maybe* look at Swerve Code, and CommandBased.
